# Azure Web Image Dwnszr

![CI](https://github.com/mikaelweave/azure_web_img_dwnszr/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

Why another Serverless Image ResizerÂ®? While writing a few static websites, I could not find any existing solution that met my requirements around image management. I need something that:
- â¬‡ Downsizes copies of images on upload and stores them (storage vs compute)
- ðŸ”µ Also outputs in WEBP image files for Chrome
- ðŸ—ƒ Creates metadata for consumption by static website generators
- ðŸ’° Cost-effective for smaller sites (pay as you go vs tiers)

Enter *Azure Image Web Dwnszr* which is an opinionated solution to my requirements!

## Deploying

A sample deployment script has been included ([sample-deployment.sh](./sample-deployment.sh)) in this repository. Ensure you have a `.env` file configured (in the same format as `.env.sample`), the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) installed, an Azure subscription to deploy to, and execute the commands in that script.
